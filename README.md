## Overview

![screenshot](devchallenge001.png)

- Demo is above ^^^
- I think I struggled most with those checkboxes and numbers. At first I really wanted to use the numbers on the ordered list but I just wasn't able to style them properly, so I said screw it and turned them into spans. Spans were made for backgrounds and padding lol. Then those checkboxes, as I searched the web for some way to add a color to the background, the majority of solutions suggested getting rid of the checkbox and adding my own version of one. It really should be easier than that like I can't believe its 2022 and we can't style a checkbox! ðŸ˜¤ Anyway, thank goodness for StackOverflow, some genius on there thought to use filters on checkboxes and saved me the trouble of making my own!  
- I learned filters are awesome, spans are handy and that html6/css5 need to make numbers and checkboxes style-able (I don't think that's a word, but let's pretend it is). 
- Inspirational Quote of the Day: "Try not to break the Multiverse, Stephen" - Wanda Maximoff (EEP - I love her, she was amazing in Dr.Strange 2)
- Guys, I'm just now realizing the checkboxes did not need a color...you know what, it's okay I learned something out of it anyway!
